The tmp folder is used for import dump. Configuring multiple regions \uf0c1 The file import_multiple_regions.sh needs to be edited as per your requirement: List of countries. eg: COUNTRIES=\"europe/monaco europe/andorra\" Path to Build directory. eg: NOMINATIMBUILD=\"/srv/nominatim/build\" Path to Update directory. eg: UPDATEDIR=\"/srv/nominatim/update\" Replication URL. eg: BASEURL=\"https://download.geofabrik.de\" DOWNCOUNTRYPOSTFIX=\"-latest.osm.pbf\" Setting up multiple regions \uf0c1 Tip If your database already exists and you want to add more countries, replace the setting up part ${SETUPFILE} --osm-file ${UPDATEDIR}/tmp/combined.osm.pbf --all 2>&1 with ${UPDATEFILE} --import-file ${UPDATEDIR}/tmp/combined.osm.pbf --index --index-instances N 2>&1 where N is the numbers of CPUs in your system. Run the following command from your Nominatim directory after configuring the file. bash ./utils/import_multiple_regions.sh Important This file uses osmium-tool. It must be installed before executing the import script. Installation instructions can be found here . Updating multiple regions \uf0c1 To import multiple regions in your database, you need to configure and run utils/update_database.sh . This uses the update directory set up while setting up the DB. Configuring multiple regions \uf0c1 The file update_database.sh needs to be edited as per your requirement: List of countries. eg: COUNTRIES=\"europe/monaco europe/andorra\" Path to Build directory. eg: NOMINATIMBUILD=\"/srv/nominatim/build\" Path to Update directory. eg: UPDATEDIR=\"/srv/nominatim/update\" Replication URL. eg: BASEURL=\"https://download.geofabrik.de\" DOWNCOUNTRYPOSTFIX=\"-updates\" Followup can be set according to your installation. eg: For Photon, FOLLOWUP=\"curl http://localhost:2322/nominatim-update\" will handle the indexing. Updating the database \uf0c1 Run the following command from your Nominatim directory after configuring the file. bash ./utils/update_database.sh This will get diffs from the replication server, import diffs and index the database. The default replication server in the script( Geofabrik ) provides daily updates. Importing Nominatim to an external PostgreSQL database \uf0c1 You can install Nominatim using a database that runs on a different server when you have physical access to the file system on the other server. Nominatim uses a custom normalization library that needs to be made accessible to the PostgreSQL server. This section explains how to set up the normalization library. Option 1: Compiling the library on the database server \uf0c1 The most sure way to get a working library is to compile it on the database server. From the prerequisites you need at least cmake, gcc and the PostgreSQL server package. Clone or unpack the Nominatim source code, enter the source directory and create and enter a build directory. cd Nominatim mkdir build cd build Now configure cmake to only build the PostgreSQL module and build it: cmake -DBUILD_IMPORTER=off -DBUILD_API=off -DBUILD_TESTS=off -DBUILD_DOCS=off -DBUILD_OSM2PGSQL=off .. make When done, you find the normalization library in build/module/nominatim.so . Copy it to a place where it is readable and executable by the PostgreSQL server process. Option 2: Compiling the library on the import machine \uf0c1 You can also compile the normalization library on the machine from where you run the import. Important You can only do this when the database server and the import machine have the same architecture and run the same version of Linux. Otherwise there is no guarantee that the compiled library is compatible with the PostgreSQL server running on the database server. Make sure that the PostgreSQL server package is installed on the machine with the same version as on the database server . You do not need to install the PostgreSQL server itself. Download and compile Nominatim as per standard instructions. Once done, you find the normalization library in build/module/nominatim.so . Copy the file to the database server at a location where it is readable and executable by the PostgreSQL server process. Running the import \uf0c1 On the client side you now need to configure the import to point to the correct location of the library on the database server . Add the following line to your your .env file: NOMINATIM_DATABASE_MODULE_PATH=\"<directory on the database server where nominatim.so resides>\" Now change the NOMINATIM_DATABASE_DSN to point to your remote server and continue to follow the standard instructions for importing .","title":"Advanced Installations"},{"location":"admin/Advanced-Installations/#advanced-installations","text":"This page contains instructions for setting up multiple countries in your Nominatim database.

Make sure you remove the server development libraries ( postgresql-server-dev-9.5 on Ubuntu) and recompile ( cmake .. && make ). I see the error \"ERROR: permission denied for language c\" \uf0c1 nominatim.so , written in C, is required to be installed on the database server. Some managed database (cloud) services like Amazon RDS do not allow this. There is currently no work-around other than installing a database on a non-managed machine. I see the error: \"function transliteration(text) does not exist\" \uf0c1 Reinstall the nominatim functions with nominatim refresh --functions and check for any errors, e.g. a missing nominatim.so file. I see the error: \"ERROR: mmap (remap) failed\" \uf0c1 This may be a simple out-of-memory error. Try reducing the memory used for --osm2pgsql-cache . Also make sure that overcommitting memory is allowed: cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory should print 0 or 1. If you are using a flatnode file, then it may also be that the underlying filesystem does not fully support 'mmap'. A notable candidate is virtualbox's vboxfs.

It's something PostgreSQL internal Nominatim doesn't control. And PostgreSQL forums suggest it's threading related but definitely some kind of crash of a process. Users reported either rebooting the server, different hardware or just trying the import again worked. The website shows: \"Could not get word tokens\" \uf0c1 The server cannot access your database.

It is assumed that you have already successfully installed the Nominatim software itself and the nominatim tool can be found in your PATH . If this is not the case, return to the installation page . Creating the project directory \uf0c1 Before you start the import, you should create a project directory for your new database installation. This directory receives all data that is related to a single Nominatim setup: configuration, extra data, etc. Create a project directory apart from the Nominatim software and change into the directory: mkdir ~/nominatim-planet cd ~/nominatim-planet In the following, we refer to the project directory as $PROJECT_DIR . To be able to copy&paste instructions, you can export the appropriate variable: export PROJECT_DIR=~/nominatim-planet The Nominatim tool assumes per default that the current working directory is the project directory but you may explicitly state a different directory using the --project-dir parameter. The following instructions assume that you run all commands from the project directory. Migration Tip Nominatim used to be run directly from the build directory until version 3.6. Essentially, the build directory functioned as the project directory for the database installation. This setup still works and can be useful for development purposes. It is not recommended anymore for production setups. Create a project directory that is separate from the Nominatim software. Configuration setup in .env \uf0c1 The Nominatim server can be customized via an .env configuration file in the project directory. This is a file in dotenv format which looks the same as variable settings in a standard shell environment. You can also set the same configuration via environment variables. All settings have a NOMINATIM_ prefix to avoid conflicts with other environment variables. There are lots of configuration settings you can tweak. Have a look at settings/env.default for a full list. Most should have a sensible default. Flatnode files \uf0c1 If you plan to import a large dataset (e.g. Europe, North America, planet), you should also enable flatnode storage of node locations. With this setting enabled, node coordinates are stored in a simple file instead of the database. This will save you import time and disk storage. Add to your .env : NOMINATIM_FLATNODE_FILE=\"/path/to/flatnode.file\" Replace the second part with a suitable path on your system and make sure the directory exists. There should be at least 75GB of free space. Downloading additional data \uf0c1 Wikipedia/Wikidata rankings \uf0c1 Wikipedia can be used as an optional auxiliary data source to help indicate the importance of OSM features. Nominatim will work without this information but it will improve the quality of the results if this is installed. This data is available as a binary download. Put it into your project directory: cd $PROJECT_DIR wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/wikimedia-importance.sql.gz The file is about 400MB and adds around 4GB to the Nominatim database. Tip If you forgot to download the wikipedia rankings, you can also add importances after the import. Download the files, then run nominatim refresh --wiki-data --importance . Updating importances for a planet can take a couple of hours. Great Britain, USA postcodes \uf0c1 Nominatim can use postcodes from an external source to improve searches that involve a GB or US postcode. This data can be optionally downloaded into the project directory: cd $PROJECT_DIR wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/gb_postcode_data.sql.gz wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/us_postcode_data.sql.gz Choosing the data to import \uf0c1 In its default setup Nominatim is configured to import the full OSM data set for the entire planet. Such a setup requires a powerful machine with at least 64GB of RAM and around 900GB of SSD hard disks. Depending on your use case there are various ways to reduce the amount of data imported. This section discusses these methods. They can also be combined. Using an extract \uf0c1 If you only need geocoding for a smaller region, then precomputed OSM extracts are a good way to reduce the database size and import time. Geofabrik offers extracts for most countries. They even have daily updates which can be used with the update process described in the next section . There are also other providers for extracts . Please be aware that some extracts are not cut exactly along the country boundaries. As a result some parts of the boundary may be missing which means that Nominatim cannot compute the areas for some administrative areas. Dropping Data Required for Dynamic Updates \uf0c1 About half of the data in Nominatim's database is not really used for serving the API. It is only there to allow the data to be updated from the latest changes from OSM. For many uses these dynamic updates are not really required. If you don't plan to apply updates, you can run the import with the --no-updates parameter. This will drop the dynamic part of the database as soon as it is not required anymore. You can also drop the dynamic part later using the following command: nominatim freeze Note that you still need to provide for sufficient disk space for the initial import. So this option is particularly interesting if you plan to transfer the database or reuse the space later. Reverse-only Imports \uf0c1 If you only want to use the Nominatim database for reverse lookups or if you plan to use the installation only for exports to a photon database, then you can set up a database without search indexes. Add --reverse-only to your setup command above. This saves about 5% of disk space. Filtering Imported Data \uf0c1 Nominatim normally sets up a full search database containing administrative boundaries, places, streets, addresses and POI data. There are also other import styles available which only read selected data: settings/import-admin.style Only import administrative boundaries and places. settings/import-street.style Like the admin style but also adds streets. settings/import-address.style Import all data necessary to compute addresses down to house number level. settings/import-full.style Default style that also includes points of interest. settings/import-extratags.style Like the full style but also adds most of the OSM tags into the extratags column. The style can be changed with the configuration NOMINATIM_IMPORT_STYLE . To give you an idea of the impact of using the different styles, the table below gives rough estimates of the final database size after import of a 2020 planet and after using the --drop option. It also shows the time needed for the import on a machine with 64GB RAM, 4 CPUS and NVME disks. Note that the given sizes are just an estimate meant for comparison of style requirements. Your planet import is likely to be larger as the OSM data grows with time. style Import time DB size after drop admin 4h 215 GB 20 GB street 22h 440 GB 185 GB address 36h 545 GB 260 GB full 54h 640 GB 330 GB extratags 54h 650 GB 340 GB You can also customize the styles further. A description of the style format can be found in the development section. Initial import of the data \uf0c1 Important First try the import with a small extract, for example from Geofabrik . Download the data to import. Then issue the following command from the build directory to start the import: nominatim import --osm-file <data file> 2 > & 1 | tee setup.log Notes on full planet imports \uf0c1 Even on a perfectly configured machine the import of a full planet takes around 2 days. Once you see messages with Rank .. ETA appear, the indexing process has started. This part takes the most time. There are 30 ranks to process. Rank 26 and 30 are the most complex. They take each about a third of the total import time. If you have not reached rank 26 after two days of import, it is worth revisiting your system configuration as it may not be optimal for the import. Notes on memory usage \uf0c1 In the first step of the import Nominatim uses osm2pgsql to load the OSM data into the PostgreSQL database. This step is very demanding in terms of RAM usage. osm2pgsql and PostgreSQL are running in parallel at this point. PostgreSQL blocks at least the part of RAM that has been configured with the shared_buffers parameter during PostgreSQL tuning and needs some memory on top of that. osm2pgsql needs at least 2GB of RAM for its internal data structures, potentially more when it has to process very large relations. In addition it needs to maintain a cache for node locations. The size of this cache can be configured with the parameter --osm2pgsql-cache . When importing with a flatnode file, it is best to disable the node cache completely and leave the memory for the flatnode file. Nominatim will do this by default, so you do not need to configure anything in this case. For imports without a flatnode file, set --osm2pgsql-cache approximately to the size of the OSM pbf file you are importing. The size needs to be given in MB. Make sure you leave enough RAM for PostgreSQL and osm2pgsql as mentioned above. If the system starts swapping or you are getting out-of-memory errors, reduce the cache size or even consider using a flatnode file. Testing the installation \uf0c1 Run this script to verify all required tables and indices got created successfully. nominatim admin --check-database Now you can try out your installation by running: nominatim serve This runs a small test server normally used for development. You can use it to verify that your installation is working. Go to http://localhost:8088/status.php and you should see the message OK . You can also run a search query, e.g. http://localhost:8088/search.php?q=Berlin . To run Nominatim via webservers like Apache or nginx, please read the Deployment chapter . Tuning the database \uf0c1 Accurate word frequency information for search terms helps PostgreSQL's query planner to make the right decisions. Recomputing them can improve the performance of forward geocoding in particular under high load. To recompute word counts run: nominatim refresh --word-counts This will take a couple of hours for a full planet installation. You can also defer that step to a later point in time when you realise that performance becomes an issue. Just make sure that updates are stopped before running this function. If you want to be able to search for places by their type through special key phrases you also need to import these key phrases like this: nominatim special-phrases --import-from-wiki Note that this command downloads the phrases from the wiki link above. You need internet access for the step. Installing Tiger housenumber data for the US \uf0c1 Nominatim is able to use the official TIGER address set to complement the OSM house number data in the US. You can add TIGER data to your own Nominatim instance by following these steps. The entire US adds about 10GB to your database. Get preprocessed TIGER 2020 data: cd $PROJECT_DIR wget https://nominatim.org/data/tiger2020-nominatim-preprocessed.tar.gz Import the data into your Nominatim database: nominatim add-data --tiger-data tiger2020-nominatim-preprocessed.tar.gz Enable use of the Tiger data in your .env by adding: echo NOMINATIM_USE_US_TIGER_DATA=yes >> .env Apply the new settings: nominatim refresh --functions See the developer's guide for more information on how the data got preprocessed.","title":"Import"},{"location":"admin/Import/#importing-the-database","text":"The following instructions explain how to create a Nominatim database from an OSM planet file.

There are also step-by-step instructions available for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 20.04 Ubuntu 18.04 CentOS 8 CentOS 7.2 These OS-specific instructions can also be found in executable form in the vagrant/ directory. Users have created instructions for other frameworks. We haven't tested those and can't offer support. Docker Docker on Kubernetes Ansible Prerequisites \uf0c1 Software \uf0c1 For compiling: cmake expat proj bzip2 zlib ICU Boost libraries , including system and filesystem PostgreSQL client libraries a recent C++ compiler (gcc 5+ or Clang 3.8+) For running Nominatim: PostgreSQL (9.3+ will work, 11+ strongly recommended) PostGIS (2.2+) Python 3 (3.5+) Psycopg2 (2.7+) Python Dotenv psutil Jinja2 PyICU PHP (7.0 or later) PHP-pgsql PHP-intl (bundled with PHP) PHP-cgi (for running queries from the command line) For running continuous updates: pyosmium For dependencies for running tests and building documentation, see the Development section . Hardware \uf0c1 A minimum of 2GB of RAM is required or installation will fail. For a full planet import 64GB of RAM or more are strongly recommended. Do not report out of memory problems if you have less than 64GB RAM. For a full planet install you will need at least 900GB of hard disk space. Take into account that the OSM database is growing fast. Fast disks are essential. Using NVME disks is recommended. Even on a well configured machine the import of a full planet takes around 2 days. On traditional spinning disks, 7-8 days are more realistic. Tuning the PostgreSQL database \uf0c1 You might want to tune your PostgreSQL installation so that the later steps make best use of your hardware. You should tune the following parameters in your postgresql.conf file. shared_buffers = 2GB maintenance_work_mem = (10GB) autovacuum_work_mem = 2GB work_mem = (50MB) effective_cache_size = (24GB) synchronous_commit = off checkpoint_segments = 100 # only for postgresql <= 9.4 max_wal_size = 1GB # postgresql > 9.4 checkpoint_timeout = 10min checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9 The numbers in brackets behind some parameters seem to work fine for 64GB RAM machine. Adjust to your setup. A higher number for max_wal_size means that PostgreSQL needs to run checkpoints less often but it does require the additional space on your disk. Autovacuum must not be switched off because it ensures that the tables are frequently analysed. If your machine has very little memory, you might consider setting: autovacuum_max_workers = 1 and even reduce autovacuum_work_mem further. This will reduce the amount of memory that autovacuum takes away from the import process. For the initial import, you should also set: fsync = off full_page_writes = off Don't forget to reenable them after the initial import or you risk database corruption. Downloading and building Nominatim \uf0c1 Downloading the latest release \uf0c1 You can download the latest release from nominatim.org . The release contains all necessary files. Just unpack it. Downloading the latest development version \uf0c1 If you want to install latest development version from github, make sure to also check out the osm2pgsql subproject: git clone --recursive git://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim.git The development version does not include the country grid. Download it separately: wget -O Nominatim/data/country_osm_grid.sql.gz https://www.nominatim.org/data/country_grid.sql.gz Building Nominatim \uf0c1 The code must be built in a separate directory. Create the directory and change into it. mkdir build cd build Nominatim uses cmake and make for building.

Adjust to your setup. A higher number for max_wal_size means that PostgreSQL needs to run checkpoints less often but it does require the additional space on your disk. Autovacuum must not be switched off because it ensures that the tables are frequently analysed. If your machine has very little memory, you might consider setting: autovacuum_max_workers = 1 and even reduce autovacuum_work_mem further. This will reduce the amount of memory that autovacuum takes away from the import process.

Please follow the following steps: stop any updates that are potentially running update Nominatim to the newer version go to your project directory and run nominatim admin --migrate (optionally) restart updates Below you find additional migrations and hints about other structural and breaking changes. Please read them before running the migration. Note If you are migrating from a version <3.6, then you still have to follow the manual migration steps up to 3.6. 3.6.0 -> 3.7.0 \uf0c1 New location for data files \uf0c1 External data files for Wikipedia importance, postcodes etc. are no longer expected to reside in the source tree by default. Instead they will be searched in the project directory. If you have an automated setup script you must either adapt the download location or explicitly set the location of the files to the old place in your .env . Introducing nominatim command line tool \uf0c1 The various php utilities have been replaced with a single nominatim command line tool. Make sure to adapt any scripts. There is no direct 1:1 matching between the old utilities and the commands of nominatim CLI. The following list gives you a list of nominatim sub-commands that contain functionality of each script: ./utils/setup.php: import , freeze , refresh ./utils/update.php: replication , add-data , index , refresh ./utils/specialphrases.php: special-phrases ./utils/check_import_finished.php: admin ./utils/warm.php: admin ./utils/export.php: export Try nominatim <command> --help for more information about each subcommand. ./utils/query.php no longer exists in its old form. nominatim search provides a replacement but returns different output. Switch to normalized house numbers \uf0c1 The housenumber column in the placex table uses now normalized version. The automatic migration step will convert the column but this may take a very long time. It is advisable to take the machine offline while doing that. 3.5.0 -> 3.6.0 \uf0c1 Change of layout of search_name_* tables \uf0c1 The table need a different index for nearest place lookup. Recreate the indexes using the following shell script: for table in ` psql -d nominatim -c \"SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE 'search_name_%'\" -tA | grep -v search_name_blank ` ; do psql -d nominatim -c \"DROP INDEX idx_ ${ table } _centroid_place; CREATE INDEX idx_ ${ table } _centroid_place ON ${ table } USING gist (centroid) WHERE ((address_rank >= 2) AND (address_rank <= 25)); DROP INDEX idx_ ${ table } _centroid_street; CREATE INDEX idx_ ${ table } _centroid_street ON ${ table } USING gist (centroid) WHERE ((address_rank >= 26) AND (address_rank <= 27))\" ; done Removal of html output \uf0c1 The debugging UI is no longer directly provided with Nominatim. Instead we now provide a simple Javascript application. Please refer to Setting up the Nominatim UI for details on how to set up the UI. The icons served together with the API responses have been moved to the nominatim-ui project as well. If you want to keep the icon field in the response, you need to set CONST_MapIcon_URL to the URL of the /mapicon directory of nominatim-ui. Change order during indexing \uf0c1 When reindexing places during updates, there is now a different order used which needs a different database index. Create it with the following SQL command: CREATE INDEX idx_placex_pendingsector_rank_address ON placex USING BTREE ( rank_address , geometry_sector ) WHERE indexed_status > 0 ; You can then drop the old index with: DROP INDEX idx_placex_pendingsector ; Unused index \uf0c1 This index has been unused ever since the query using it was changed two years ago. Saves about 12GB on a planet installation. DROP INDEX idx_placex_geometry_reverse_lookupPoint ; Switching to dotenv \uf0c1 As part of the work changing the configuration format, the configuration for the website is now using a separate configuration file. To create the configuration file, run the following command after updating: ./utils/setup.php --setup-website 3.4.0 -> 3.5.0 \uf0c1 New Wikipedia/Wikidata importance tables \uf0c1 The wikipedia_* tables have a new format that also includes references to Wikidata. You need to update the computation functions and the tables as follows: download the new Wikipedia tables as described in the import section reimport the tables: ./utils/setup.php --import-wikipedia-articles update the functions: ./utils/setup.php --create-functions --enable-diff-updates create a new lookup index: CREATE INDEX idx_placex_wikidata ON placex USING BTREE (( extratags -> 'wikidata' )) WHERE extratags ?

This section provides a quick start how to use nominatim-ui with your installation. For more details, please also have a look at the README of nominatim-ui . Installing nominatim-ui \uf0c1 nominatim-ui does not need any special installation, just download, configure and run it. Clone the source from github: git clone https://github.com/osm-search/nominatim-ui Copy the example configuration into the right place: cd nominatim-ui cp dist/config.example.js dist/config.js Now adapt the configuration to your needs. You need at least to change the Nominatim_API_Endpoint to point to your Nominatim installation. Then you can just test it locally by spinning up a webserver in the dist directory. For example, with Python: cd nominatim-ui/dist python3 -m http.server 8765 The website is now available at http://localhost:8765 . Forwarding searches to nominatim-ui \uf0c1 Nominatim used to provide the search interface directly by itself when format=html was requested. For all endpoints except for /reverse and /lookup this even used to be the default. The following section describes how to set up Apache or nginx, so that your users are forwarded to nominatim-ui when they go to URL that formerly presented the UI. Setting up forwarding in Nginx \uf0c1 First of all make nominatim-ui available under /ui on your webserver: server { # Here is the Nominatim setup as described in the Installation section location /ui/ { alias <full path to the nominatim-ui directory>/dist/ ; index index.html ; } } Now we need to find out if a URL should be forwarded to the UI. Add the following map commands outside the server section: # Inspect the format parameter in the query arguments. We are interested # if it is set to html or something else or if it is missing completely. map $args $format { default default ; ~(^|&)format=html(&|$) html ; ~(^|&)format= other ; } # Determine from the URI and the format parameter above if forwarding is needed. map $uri/$format $forward_to_ui { default 1 ; # The default is to forward. ~^/ui 0 ; # If the URI point to the UI already, we are done. ~/other$ 0 ; # An explicit non-html format parameter. No forwarding. ~/reverse.*/default 0 ; # Reverse and lookup assume xml format when ~/lookup.*/default 0 ; # no format parameter is given. No forwarding. } The $forward_to_ui parameter can now be used to conditionally forward the calls: # When no endpoint is given , default to search . # Need to add a rewrite so that the rewrite rules below catch it correctly . rewrite ^/ $ / search ; location @php { # fastcgi stuff .. if ( $ forward_to_ui ) { rewrite ^ ( /[ ^/ ]* ) https : // yourserver . com / ui $ 1. html redirect ; } } location ~ [ ^/ ] \\ . php ( /| $ ) { # fastcgi stuff .. if ( $ forward_to_ui ) { rewrite (. * ). php https : // yourserver . com / ui $ 1. html redirect ; } } Warning Be aware that the rewrite commands are slightly different for URIs with and without the .php suffix. Reload nginx and the UI should be available. Setting up forwarding in Apache \uf0c1 First of all make nominatim-ui available in the ui/ subdirectory where Nominatim is installed. For example, given you have set up an alias under nominatim like this: Alias /nominatim /home/vagrant/build/website you need to insert the following rules for nominatim-ui before that alias: <Directory \"/home/vagrant/nominatim-ui/dist\" > DirectoryIndex search.html Require all granted </Directory> Alias /nominatim/ui /home/vagrant/nominatim-ui/dist Replace /home/vagrant/nominatim-ui with the directory where you have cloned nominatim-ui. Important The alias for nominatim-ui must come before the alias for the Nominatim website directory. To set up forwarding, the Apache rewrite module is needed. Enable it with: sudo a2enmod rewrite Then add rewrite rules to the Directory directive of the Nominatim website directory like this: <Directory \"/home/vagrant/build/website\" > Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews AddType text/html .php Require all granted RewriteEngine On # This must correspond to the URL where nominatim can be found. RewriteBase \"/nominatim/\" # If no endpoint is given, then use search. RewriteRule ^(/|$) \"search.php\" # If format-html is explicity requested, forward to the UI. RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \"format=html\" RewriteRule ^([^/]+).php ui/$1.html [R,END] # Same but .php suffix is missing. RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \"format=html\" RewriteRule ^([^/]+) ui/$1.html [R,END] # If no format parameter is there then forward anything # but /reverse and /lookup to the UI.

The address of my search results contains far-away places that don't belong there. \uf0c1 Nominatim computes the address from two sources in the OpenStreetMap data: from administrative boundaries and from place nodes. Boundaries are the more useful source. They precisely describe an area. So it is very clear for Nominatim if a point belongs to an area or not. Place nodes are more complicated. These are only points without any precise extent. So Nominatim has to take a guess and assume that an address belongs to the closest place node it can find. In an ideal world, Nominatim would not need the place nodes but there are many places on earth where there are no precise boundaries available for all parts that make up an address. This is in particular true for the more local address parts, like villages and suburbs. Therefore it is not possible to completely dismiss place nodes. And sometimes they sneak in where they don't belong. As a OpenStreetMap mapper, you can improve the situation in two ways: if you see a place node for which already an administrative area exists, then you should link the two by adding the node with a 'label' role to the boundary relation. If there is no administrative area, you can add the approximate extent of the place and tag it place= as well. 2. When doing reverse search, the address details have parts that don't contain the point I was looking up. \uf0c1 There is a common misconception how the reverse API call works in Nominatim. Reverse does not give you the address of the point you asked for. Reverse returns the closest object to the point you asked for and then returns the address of that object. Now, if you are close to a border, then the closest object may be across that border. When Nominatim then returns the address, it contains the county/state/country across the border. 3. I get different counties/states/countries when I change the zoom parameter in the reverse query. How is that possible? \uf0c1 This is basically the same problem as in the previous answer. The zoom level influences at which search rank Nominatim starts looking for the closest object. So the closest house number maybe on one side of the border while the closest street is on the other. As the address details contain the address of the closest object found, you might sometimes get one result, sometimes the other for the closest point. 4. Can you return the continent? \uf0c1 Nominatim assigns each map feature one country. Those outside any administrative boundaries are assigned a special no-country. Continents or other super-national administrations (e.g. European Union, NATO, Custom unions) are not supported, see also Administrative Boundary . 5. Can you return the timezone? \uf0c1 See this separate OpenStreetMap-based project Timezone Boundary Builder . 6. I want to download a list of streets/restaurants of a city/region \uf0c1 The Overpass API is more suited for these kinds of queries. That said if you installed your own Nominatim instance you can use the nominatim export PHP script as basis to return such lists.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"api/Faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"api/Faq/#api-results","text":"","title":"API Results"},{"location":"api/Faq/#1-the-address-of-my-search-results-contains-far-away-places-that-dont-belong-there","text":"Nominatim computes the address from two sources in the OpenStreetMap data: from administrative boundaries and from place nodes.

Additional information requested with extratags=1 and namedetails=1 can be found in extra elements as sub-element of extratags and namedetails respectively. Notes on field values \uf0c1 place_id is not a persistent id \uf0c1 The place_id is an internal identifier that is assigned data is imported into a Nominatim database. The same OSM object will have a different value on another server. It may even change its ID on the same server when it is removed and reimported while updating the database with fresh OSM data. It is thus not useful to treat it as permanent for later use. The combination osm_type + osm_id is slighly better but remember in OpenStreetMap mappers can delete, split, recreate places (and those get a new osm_id ), there is no link between those old and new ids. Places can also change their meaning without changing their osm_id , e.g. when a restaurant is retagged as supermarket. For a more in-depth discussion see Permanent ID . If you need an ID that is consistent over multiple installations of Nominatim, then you should use the combination of osm_type + osm_id + class . OSM reference \uf0c1 Nominatim may sometimes return special objects that do not correspond directly to an object in OpenStreetMap. These are: Postcodes . Nominatim returns an postcode point created from all mapped postcodes of the same name. The class and type of these object is place=postcdode . No osm_type and osm_id are included in the result. Housenumber interpolations . Nominatim returns a single interpolated housenumber from the interpolation way. The class and type are place=house and osm_type and osm_id correspond to the interpolation way in OSM. TIGER housenumber. Nominatim returns a single interpolated housenumber from the TIGER data. The class and type are place=house and osm_type and osm_id correspond to the street mentioned in the result. Please note that the osm_type and osm_id returned may be changed in the future. You should not expect to only find node , way and relation for the type. boundingbox \uf0c1 Comma separated list of min latitude, max latitude, min longitude, max longitude. The whole planet would be -90,90,-180,180 . Can be used to pan and center the map on the result, for example with leafletjs mapping library map.fitBounds([[bbox[0],bbox[2]],[bbox[1],bbox[3]]], {padding: [20, 20], maxzoom: 16}); Bounds crossing the antimeridian have a min latitude -180 and max latitude 180, essentially covering the entire planet (see issue 184 ). addressdetails \uf0c1 Address details in the xml and json formats return a list of names together with a designation label. Per default the following labels may appear: continent country, country_code region, state, state_district, county municipality, city, town, village city_district, district, borough, suburb, subdivision hamlet, croft, isolated_dwelling neighbourhood, allotments, quarter city_block, residental, farm, farmyard, industrial, commercial, retail road house_number, house_name emergency, historic, military, natural, landuse, place, railway, man_made, aerialway, boundary, amenity, aeroway, club, craft, leisure, office, mountain_pass, shop, tourism, bridge, tunnel, waterway They roughly correspond to the classification of the OpenStreetMap data according to either the place tag or the main key of the object.","title":"Place Output Formats"},{"location":"api/Output/#place-output","text":"The /reverse , /search and /lookup API calls produce very similar output which is explained in this section.

The combination osm_type + osm_id is slighly better but remember in OpenStreetMap mappers can delete, split, recreate places (and those get a new osm_id ), there is no link between those old and new ids. Places can also change their meaning without changing their osm_id , e.g. when a restaurant is retagged as supermarket. For a more in-depth discussion see Permanent ID .

How it works \uf0c1 The reverse geocoding API does not exactly compute the address for the coordinate it receives. It works by finding the closest suitable OSM object and returning its address information. This may occasionally lead to unexpected results. First of all, Nominatim only includes OSM objects in its index that are suitable for searching. Small, unnamed paths for example are missing from the database and can therefore not be used for reverse geocoding either. The other issue to be aware of is that the closest OSM object may not always have a similar enough address to the coordinate you were requesting. For example, in dense city areas it may belong to a completely different street. Parameters \uf0c1 The main format of the reverse API is https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?lat=<value>&lon=<value>&<params> where lat and lon are latitude and longitutde of a coordinate in WGS84 projection. The API returns exactly one result or an error when the coordinate is in an area with no OSM data coverage. Additional paramters are accepted as listed below. Deprecation warning The reverse API used to allow address lookup for a single OSM object by its OSM id. This use is now deprecated. Use the Address Lookup API instead.

Nominatim supports structured and free-form search queries. The search query may also contain special phrases which are translated into specific OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags (e.g. Pub => amenity=pub ). This can be used to narrow down the kind of objects to be returned. Warning Special phrases are not suitable to query all objects of a certain type in an area. Nominatim will always just return a collection of the best matches. To download OSM data by object type, use the Overpass API . Parameters \uf0c1 The search API has the following format: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?<params> The search term may be specified with two different sets of parameters: q=<query> Free-form query string to search for. Free-form queries are processed first left-to-right and then right-to-left if that fails. So you may search for pilkington avenue, birmingham as well as for birmingham, pilkington avenue . Commas are optional, but improve performance by reducing the complexity of the search. street=<housenumber> <streetname> city=<city> county=<county> state=<state> country=<country> postalcode=<postalcode> Alternative query string format split into several parameters for structured requests. Structured requests are faster but are less robust against alternative OSM tagging schemas. Do not combine with q=<query> parameter . Both query forms accept the additional parameters listed below. Output format \uf0c1 format=[xml|json|jsonv2|geojson|geocodejson] See Place Output Formats for details on each format.

Either use a standard RFC2616 accept-language string or a simple comma-separated list of language codes. Result limitation \uf0c1 countrycodes=<countrycode>[,<countrycode>][,<countrycode>]... Limit search results to one or more countries. <countrycode> must be the ISO 3166-1alpha2 code, e.g. gb for the United Kingdom, de for Germany. Each place in Nominatim is assigned to one country code based on OSM country boundaries. In rare cases a place may not be in any country at all, for example, in international waters. exclude_place_ids=<place_id,[place_id],[place_id] If you do not want certain OSM objects to appear in the search result, give a comma separated list of the place_id s you want to skip. This can be used to retrieve additional search results. For example, if a previous query only returned a few results, then including those here would cause the search to return other, less accurate, matches (if possible). limit=<integer> Limit the number of returned results. (Default: 10, Maximum: 50) viewbox=<x1>,<y1>,<x2>,<y2> The preferred area to find search results. Any two corner points of the box are accepted as long as they span a real box. x is longitude, y is latitude. bounded=[0|1] When a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within that viewbox (see above).

Nominatim uses its own data output style 'gazetteer', which differs from the output style created for map rendering. Database Layout \uf0c1 The gazetteer style produces a single table place with the following rows: osm_type - kind of OSM object ( N - node, W - way, R - relation) osm_id - original OSM ID class - key of principal tag defining the object type type - value of principal tag defining the object type name - collection of tags that contain a name or reference admin_level - numerical value of the tagged administrative level address - collection of tags defining the address of an object extratags - collection of additional interesting tags that are not directly relevant for searching geometry - geometry of the object (in WGS84) A single OSM object may appear multiple times in this table when it is tagged with multiple tags that may constitute a principal tag. Take for example a motorway bridge. In OSM, this would be a way which is tagged with highway=motorway and bridge=yes . This way would appear in the place table once with class of highway and once with a class of bridge . Thus the unique key for place is ( osm_type , osm_id , class ). Configuring the Import \uf0c1 How tags are interpreted and assigned to the different place columns can be configured via the import style configuration file ( NOMINATIM_IMPORT_STYLE ). This is a JSON file which contains a list of rules which are matched against every tag of every object and then assign the tag its specific role. Configuration Rules \uf0c1 A single rule looks like this: { \"keys\" : [ \"key1\" , \"key2\" , ... ], \"values\" : { \"value1\" : \"prop\" , \"value2\" : \"prop1,prop2\" } } A rule first defines a list of keys to apply the rule to. This is always a list of strings. The string may have four forms. An empty string matches against any key. A string that ends in an asterisk * is a prefix match and accordingly matches against any key that starts with the given string (minus the * ). A suffix match can be defined similarly with a string that starts with a * . Any other string constitutes an exact match. The second part of the rules defines a list of values and the properties that apply to a successful match. Value strings may be either empty, which means that they match any value, or describe an exact match. Prefix or suffix matching of values is not possible. For a rule to match, it has to find a valid combination of keys and values. The resulting property is that of the matched values. The rules in a configuration file are processed sequentially and the first match for each tag wins. A rule where key and value are the empty string is special. This defines the fallback when none of the rules match. The fallback is always used as a last resort when nothing else matches, no matter where the rule appears in the file. Defining multiple fallback rules is not allowed. What happens in this case, is undefined. Tag Properties \uf0c1 One or more of the following properties may be given for each tag: main A principal tag.

This is always a list of strings. The string may have four forms. An empty string matches against any key. A string that ends in an asterisk * is a prefix match and accordingly matches against any key that starts with the given string (minus the * ). A suffix match can be defined similarly with a string that starts with a * . Any other string constitutes an exact match. The second part of the rules defines a list of values and the properties that apply to a successful match. Value strings may be either empty, which means that they match any value, or describe an exact match. Prefix or suffix matching of values is not possible. For a rule to match, it has to find a valid combination of keys and values. The resulting property is that of the matched values. The rules in a configuration file are processed sequentially and the first match for each tag wins. A rule where key and value are the empty string is special. This defines the fallback when none of the rules match. The fallback is always used as a last resort when nothing else matches, no matter where the rule appears in the file.

Both can be assigned a value between 0 and 30. They serve slightly different purposes, which are explained in this chapter. Search rank \uf0c1 The search rank describes the extent and importance of a place. It is used when ranking search results. Simply put, if there are two results for a search query which are otherwise equal, then the result with the lower search rank will be appear higher in the result list. Search ranks are not so important these days because many well-known places use the Wikipedia importance ranking instead. The following table gives an overview of the kind of features that Nominatim expects for each rank: rank typical place types extent 1-3 oceans, continents - 4 countries - 5-9 states, regions, provinces - 10-12 counties - 13-16 cities, municipalities, islands 15 km 17-18 towns, boroughs 4 km 19 villages, suburbs 2 km 20 hamlets, farms, neighbourhoods 1 km 21-25 isolated dwellings, city blocks 500 m The extent column describes how far a feature is assumed to reach when it is mapped only as a point. Larger features like countries and states are usually available with their exact area in the OpenStreetMap data. That is why no extent is given. Address rank \uf0c1 The address rank describes where a place shows up in an address hierarchy. Usually only administrative boundaries and place nodes and areas are eligible to be part of an address. Places that should not appear in the address must have an address rank of 0. The following table gives an overview how ranks are mapped to address parts: rank address part 1-3 unused 4 country 5-9 state 10-12 county 13-16 city 17-21 suburb 22-24 neighbourhood 25 squares, farms, localities 26-27 street 28-30 POI/house number The country rank 4 usually doesn't show up in the address parts of an object. The country is determined indirectly from the country code. Ranks 5-24 can be assigned more or less freely. They make up the major part of the address. Rank 25 is also an addressing rank but it is special because while it can be the parent to a POI with an addr:place of the same name, it cannot be a parent to streets. Use it for place features that are technically on the same level as a street (e.g. squares, city blocks) or for places that should not normally appear in an address unless explicitly tagged so (e.g place=locality which should be uninhabited and as such not addressable). The street ranks 26 and 27 are handled slightly differently. Only one object from these ranks shows up in an address. For POI level objects like shops, buildings or house numbers always use rank 30. Ranks 28 is reserved for house number interpolations. 29 is for internal use only. Rank configuration \uf0c1 Search and address ranks are assigned to a place when it is first imported into the database. There are a few hard-coded rules for the assignment: postcodes follow special rules according to their length boundaries that are not areas and railway=rail are dropped completely the following are always search rank 30 and address rank 0: highway nodes landuse that is not an area Other than that, the ranks can be freely assigned via the JSON file according to their type and the country they are in. The name of the config file to be used can be changed with the setting NOMINATIM_ADDRESS_LEVEL_CONFIG . The address level configuration must consist of an array of configuration entries, each containing a tag definition and an optional country array: [ { \"tags\" : { \"place\" : { \"county\" : 12, \"city\" : 16, }, \"landuse\" : { \"residential\" : 22, \"\" : 30 } } }, { \"countries\" : [ \"ca\", \"us\" ], \"tags\" : { \"boundary\" : { \"administrative8\" : 18, \"administrative9\" : 20 }, \"landuse\" : { \"residential\" : [22, 0] } } } ] The countries field contains a list of countries (as ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 code) for which the definition applies. When the field is omitted, then the definition is used as a fallback, when nothing more specific for a given country exists. tags contains the ranks for key/value pairs. The ranks can be either a single number, in which case they are the search and address rank, or an array of search and address rank (in that order). The value may be left empty. Then the rank is used when no more specific value is found for the given key. Countries and key/value combination may appear in multiple definitions. Just make sure that each combination of country/key/value appears only once per file.

There are functional tests which test the API interface using a BDD test framework and there are unit tests for specific PHP functions. This test directory is sturctured as follows: -+- bdd Functional API tests | \\ | +- steps Step implementations for test descriptions | +- osm2pgsql Tests for data import via osm2pgsql | +- db Tests for internal data processing on import and update | +- api Tests for API endpoints ( search , reverse , etc . ) | +- php PHP unit tests +- python Python unit tests +- scenes Geometry test data +- testdb Base data for generating API test database PHP Unit Tests ( test/php ) \uf0c1 Unit tests for PHP code can be found in the php/ directory. They test selected PHP functions. Very low coverage. To execute the test suite run cd test/php UNIT_TEST_DSN='pgsql:dbname=nominatim_unit_tests' phpunit ../ It will read phpunit.xml which points to the library, test path, bootstrap strip and sets other parameters. It will use (and destroy) a local database 'nominatim_unit_tests'. You can set a different connection string with e.g. UNIT_TEST_DSN='pgsql:dbname=foo_unit_tests'. Python Unit Tests ( test/python ) \uf0c1 Unit tests for Python code can be found in the python/ directory. The goal is to have complete coverage of the Python library in nominatim . To execute the tests run py.test-3 test/python or pytest test/python The name of the pytest binary depends on your installation. BDD Functional Tests ( test/bdd ) \uf0c1 Functional tests are written as BDD instructions. For more information on the philosophy of BDD testing, see the Behave manual . The following explanation assume that the reader is familiar with the BDD notations of features, scenarios and steps. All possible steps can be found in the steps directory and should ideally be documented. General Usage \uf0c1 To run the functional tests, do cd test/bdd behave The tests can be configured with a set of environment variables ( behave -D key=val ): BUILDDIR - build directory of Nominatim installation to test TEMPLATE_DB - name of template database used as a skeleton for the test databases (db tests) TEST_DB - name of test database (db tests) API_TEST_DB - name of the database containing the API test data (api tests) API_TEST_FILE - OSM file to be imported into the API test database (api tests) DB_HOST - (optional) hostname of database host DB_PORT - (optional) port of database on host DB_USER - (optional) username of database login DB_PASS - (optional) password for database login SERVER_MODULE_PATH - (optional) path on the Postgres server to Nominatim module shared library file REMOVE_TEMPLATE - if true, the template and API database will not be reused during the next run. Reusing the base templates speeds up tests considerably but might lead to outdated errors for some changes in the database layout. KEEP_TEST_DB - if true, the test database will not be dropped after a test is finished. Should only be used if one single scenario is run, otherwise the result is undefined. Logging can be defined through command line parameters of behave itself. Check out behave --help for details. Also have a look at the 'work-in-progress' feature of behave which comes in handy when writing new tests. API Tests ( test/bdd/api ) \uf0c1 These tests are meant to test the different API endpoints and their parameters. They require to import several datasets into a test database. This is normally done automatically during setup of the test. The API test database is then kept around and reused in subsequent runs of behave. Use behave -DREMOVE_TEMPLATE to force a reimport of the database.

Most tests should be formulated as BDD DB creation tests (see below) instead. Code Coverage \uf0c1 The API tests also support code coverage tests. You need to install PHP_CodeCoverage . On Debian/Ubuntu run: apt-get install php-codecoverage php-xdebug Then run the API tests as follows: behave api -DPHPCOV=<coverage output dir> The output directory must be an absolute path. To generate reports, you can use the phpcov tool: phpcov merge --html=<report output dir> <coverage output dir> DB Creation Tests ( test/bdd/db ) \uf0c1 These tests check the import and update of the Nominatim database. They do not test the correctness of osm2pgsql. Each test will write some data into the place table (and optionally the planet_osm_* tables if required) and then run Nominatim's processing functions on that. These tests need to create their own test databases. By default they will be called test_template_nominatim and test_nominatim .

It uses a PostgreSQL database as a backend for storing the data. There are three basic parts to Nominatim's architecture: the data import, the address computation and the search frontend. The data import stage reads the raw OSM data and extracts all information that is useful for geocoding. This part is done by osm2pgsql, the same tool that can also be used to import a rendering database. It uses the special gazetteer output plugin in osm2pgsql/src/output-gazetter.[ch]pp . The result of the import can be found in the database table place . The address computation or indexing stage takes the data from place and adds additional information needed for geocoding. It ranks the places by importance, links objects that belong together and computes addresses and the search index. Most of this work is done in PL/pgSQL via database triggers and can be found in the files in the sql/functions/ directory. The search frontend implements the actual API. It takes search and reverse geocoding queries from the user, looks up the data and returns the results in the requested format. This part is written in PHP and can be found in the lib/ and website/ directories.","title":"Architecture Overview"},{"location":"develop/overview/#basic-architecture","text":"Nominatim provides geocoding based on OpenStreetMap data.
