# Supporting Nominatim Development

Thank you for your interest in supporting Nominatim. Your support helps to
ensure that the software is improved regularly and has a faster pace of
development. Your financial contributions are used to

* maintain, improve and modernize the code base
* look after the issue tracker and fix bugs
* promote Nominatim and extend the developer community
* add new features

You can make a one-time donation or become a regular supporter.

## Regular supporters

With a regular contribution you can ensure that development is sustainable
over a long term. You can set up monthly contributions via
[Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lonvia).

### Support contracts

You can also regularly support development through a support contract.
Purchase a monthly quota of hours you can use
to ask questions about your own installation or the software in general. Any
unused hours go in full into maintaining and improving Nominatim.


## Funding of specific features

There are some items on the wish list for Nominatim that would
fit well into the software but are not a priority for its use as a search
engine on the OpenStreetMap website. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

* include external house number data, e.g. from OpenAddresses
* running Nominatim on a shared database with a Mapnik renderer
* running Nominatim imports and updates without supervisor rights
* custom API output, including support for
  [OpenCage's address formatting](https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting)

If you are interested in funding one of these features or have other features
that you require for your use of Nominatim, please get in contact at
[nominatim@lonvia.de](mailto:nominatim@lonvia.de).
