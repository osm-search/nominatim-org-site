# Supporting Nominatim Development

ensure that the software is improved regularly and has a faster pace of
development. Your financial contributions are used to

* maintain, improve and modernize the code base
* look after the issue tracker and fix bugs
* promote Nominatim and extend the developer community
* add new features

You can make a one-time donation or become a regular supporter.

## Regular supporter

With a regular monthly or quarterly contribution you can ensure that
development is sustainable over long-term. Please contact
[nominatim@lonvia.de](mailto:nominatim@lonvia.de)
for details about a regular contribution.

## Funding of particular features

There are some items on the wish list for Nominatim that would
fit well into the software but are not a priority for its use as a search
engine on the OpenStreetMap website. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

* include external house number data, e.g. from OpenAddresses
* running Nominatim on a shared database with a Mapnik renderer

If you are interested in funding one of these features or have other features
that you require for your use of Nominatim, please get in contact at
[nominatim@lonvia.de](mailto:nominatim@lonvia.de).
