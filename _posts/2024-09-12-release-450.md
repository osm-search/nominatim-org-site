We are happy to announce the release of version 4.5.0 of Nominatim.
This is a transition release, helping you to prepare the move
towards the upcoming [Nominatim 5.0]({% link _posts/2023-12-19-roadmap-nominatim5.md %}),
which will be a pure Python application.

The most important change in this release is that Nominatim is now available
via [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/nominatim-db/) and can be installed
with a simple `pip install nominatim-db nominatim-api`. We had to change the
package structure slightly to make this possible, splitting the `nominatim`
package into two parts: `nominatim-db` (the database importer) and
`nominatim-api` (the search frontend). Please carefully read the
[migration guide](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Migration/#440-450)
about how this change might affect you. The old way of installing with
CMake is still available in this release. So you can take your time updating
to the new installation method. Nominatim 5 will then only be installable via
pip.

Other new features in this release include the possibility to customize
API output for web installations, a streamlined file format for wiki
importances, improvements to ordering results according to how well 
address parts match and a more consistent assignment of countries in disputed areas.
A more complete list of changes can be found in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim/blob/4.5.x/ChangeLog).

This is the last release to have support for PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10 and
Postgis 2.x. These version have long gone out of support, so it is time
to drop them.

Furthermore, the following Nominatim features will be removed with the
next release:

* [PHP frontend](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Deployment-PHP/).
  Please switch to the newer [Python frontend](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Deployment-Python/) instead.
* [Legacy tokenizer](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/customize/Tokenizers/#legacy-tokenizer).
  If your database still uses this tokenizer, you need to reimport using
  the [ICU tokenizer](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/customize/Tokenizers/#icu-tokenizer).
* Installation via CMake. Switch to using `pip install` instead.
* Bundeling of osm2pgsql. Use a stock osm2pgsql version 1.8 or higher.
  Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian >= 11 have appropriate packages. The packages of
  older Ubuntu version are too old and you need to compile a newer osm2pgsql
  from source.
